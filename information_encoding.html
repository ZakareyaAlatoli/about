    <h1>The things we like</h1>
    <p>
        The Earth is a fairly big place. It's full of things most people will
        never encounter, but nevertheless might want to know about. For instance,
        deep in the jungles of southern Asia lives a peculiar animal called the 
        <i>siamang</i>. You might be interested to know that they have an 
        inflatable sack under their chins, and want to know what it looks like.
        Or you might want to know what sounds they make. You can learn this in 
        seconds through a cursory search of "siamang" on YouTube.
    </p>
    <p>
        But what if no recordings of the siamang existed? Not even a single
        photograph? Then how would you learn this information? Well, you
        could travel to their natural habitat to witness them firsthand, but 
        that understandably wouldn't be worth the time and money for most. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I suppose we should be grateful someone else went through the effort
        of documenting these handsome creatures for us. Those adventurous folks
        were as captivated by them as you are now. But something you almost
        certainly did not consider, and something most of us take for granted,
        is how you can see simiangs without them actually being there.

    <h1>A journey into abstraction</h1>
    <p>
        Obviously we can see things on our phones and computers from all around
        the world because of the internet, which just works, you know? But
        how exactly <i>does</i> it work? When you get right down to it, what is 
        happening to move all this information around? To answer that, you need 
        to put yourself into the shoes of a robot.
    </p>
    <p>
        The way we learn about the world is through our senses: touch, smell,
        taste, sight, and hearing. They are the most basic way for us to know that
        there is <i>something</i> out there. If you were to break down the things
        that our senses...well...<i>sense</i>, how would you describe them? 
        Each sense deals with a rudimentary object. For instance, sight deals 
        with colors, hearing deals with sounds, touch with feelings, smell with 
        scents, and taste with flavors. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When we think of an object looking a certain way, what we are really doing 
        is imagining a batch of colors arranged in such a way that they represent
        a single thing. If you were to zoom in on a digital picture of say, your 
        face, you would notice that the image is made up of small squares (called 
        "pixels"), each with one solid color. But your brain doesn't see it that
        way. Your brain says, "This is my face", not "This is a grid of colored
        squares", even though both of those statements are correct.
    </p>
    <p>
        What your brain is doing is called <b>abstraction</b>. It is taking some 
        collection of things which are related in form or function, such as the
        pixels of an image, and treating it as a single entity. We make 
        abstractions out of anything and everything. The word "universe" is an
        abstraction of all that exists packaged into a quaint, metaphorical box.
