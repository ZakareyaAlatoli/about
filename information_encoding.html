        The Earth is a fairly big place. It's full of things most people will
        never encounter, but nevertheless might want to know about. For instance,
        deep in the jungles of southern Asia lives a peculiar animal called the 
        <i>siamang</i>. You might be interested to know that they have an 
        inflatable sack under their chins, and want to know what it looks like.
        Or you might want to know what sounds they make. You can learn this in 
        seconds through a cursory search of "siamang" on YouTube.

        But what if no recordings of the siamang existed? Not even a single
        photograph? Then how would you learn this information? Well, you
        could travel to their natural habitat to witness them firsthand, but 
        that understandably wouldn't be worth the time and money for most.

        I suppose we should be grateful someone else went through the effort
        of documenting these handsome creatures for us. Those adventurous folks
        were as captivated by them as you are now. But something you almost
        certainly did not consider, and something most of us take for granted,
        is how you can see simiangs without them actually being there.
